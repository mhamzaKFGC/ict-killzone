Here is a detailed breakdown of functional requirements for a fully-featured ICT Kill Zone Tracker web tool in HTML and JavaScript, ready for GitHub publishing:


---

I. Kill Zones to Include

Each kill zone should be clearly defined and adjustable for Daylight Saving Time (DST) and local time zones.

Kill Zone	EST Time	Description

Asia Session	8:00 PM – 11:00 PM	Start of the trading day, useful for early setups.
London Open	2:00 AM – 5:00 AM	Highest liquidity in European markets.
New York Open	7:00 AM – 10:00 AM	Highest volatility, overlaps with London.
London Close	10:00 AM – 12:00 PM	Closing of EU markets, volume fades.
Overlap Periods	7:00 AM – 8:00 AM	London + NY open = high volatility.



---

II. Detailed Functional Requirements

1. Real-Time Clock (EST + Local Time)

Show current EST time (important as ICT uses EST reference).

Show user’s local time for convenience.

Automatically adjusts for Daylight Saving Time.

Optional: Add toggle to switch between EST and local view.



---

2. Kill Zone Indicator Panel

Display each kill zone:

Status: Active / Upcoming / Ended

Time remaining until:

Zone starts

Zone ends



Show progress bar or countdown for active kill zones.



---

3. Overlap Highlighting

If two kill zones overlap (e.g., London & NY from 7–8 AM EST):

Show a special banner: “Overlap Period: Max Volatility”

Show time remaining in the overlap.

Add color highlighting to indicate stronger zones.




---

4. Interactive Kill Zone Schedule

Table or chart view showing:

All kill zones across the 24-hour period.

Allow users to scroll or select a day.


Optional toggle between:

24-hour clock view

AM/PM view




---

5. Customization Options

User preferences:

Select which kill zones to track.

Enable/disable sound or notification when a kill zone starts.

Theme switch (Light/Dark mode).

12-hour vs 24-hour format toggle.




---

6. Mobile and Desktop Compatibility

Fully responsive design:

Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Time blocks resize according to screen width.




---

7. Notifications (Optional Advanced Feature)

Optional browser push notifications:

"New York Kill Zone has started."

"Overlap between London and NY ends in 10 minutes."




---

8. Link to ICT Blog

Display prominent link/button:

“Learn More at Inner Circle Trader”

URL: https://innercircletrader.blog




---

9. Embedded Chart (Optional)

Embed a TradingView chart.

Show live EUR/USD or relevant market.



---

10. Data Source and Configuration (Optional)

Use JSON config or allow dynamic settings:

{
  "kill_zones": {
    "london_open": {"start": "02:00", "end": "05:00"},
    "ny_open": {"start": "07:00", "end": "10:00"}
  }
}



---

III. Optional Future Additions

Historical data viewer (e.g., “Show which trades happened last Monday in the Kill Zones”).

Trading strategy tips panel for each kill zone.

Calendar integration for major economic news overlays.

=============================================================

Features with Description =========
Timestamp: Time when the message was sent.
CAN ID: Unique identifier of the message (who sent it).
DLC: Data Length Code (how many bytes).
Data bytes: Actual payload (8 bytes max in standard CAN).
Arbitration ID: Sometimes the same as CAN ID.
Bus: If multiple buses are logged.
Direction: Whether message is incoming or outgoing.
Interval: Time difference between consecutive messages with same ID.
Entropy (engineered): Measures message randomness to detect fuzzing attacks.
Frequency (engineered): Frequency of messages per second (can vary under attack).

============================
Possible Usecases for the dataset
Anomaly Detection: Detecting unusual or potentially malicious behavior on the CAN bus.
Vehicle Behavior Prediction: Predicting the state of a vehicle component based on CAN message data.
Feature Engineering: Identifying patterns in the data that correlate with security risks, like odd message identifiers or byte patterns.


What can be done with the dataset
Preprocessing: You’ll likely need to clean the data, handle missing values, normalize the byte values, and perhaps extract specific features from the data bytes (e.g., grouping them into meaningful sensor readings).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand normal vs. anomalous patterns.

Anomaly Detection: Using machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, or One-Class SVM to detect abnormal CAN messages.

Feature Extraction: Creating new features, such as rolling averages of sensor values, bitwise operations on data bytes, or aggregate statistics.

_________________
target: The target column indicates what you're trying to predict or classify (e.g., anomaly detection, classification of message types, etc.)
